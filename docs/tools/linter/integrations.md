# Integrations

**Mago** includes specialized sets of linting rules designed for popular PHP frameworks and libraries. These "integrations" allow Mago to provide more intelligent and context-aware feedback for your specific stack.

When an integration is enabled, Mago will automatically activate all the rules associated with it. You can still configure or disable individual rules from an integration in your `[linter.rules]` table if needed.

## Available Integrations

Mago is built with the broader PHP ecosystem in mind and includes support for a wide range of tools.

> **Note:** While many integrations are listed below for future support, only **Laravel**, **PHPUnit**, **PSL**, and **Symfony** currently have specialized rules. Rules for other integrations are planned for future releases.
