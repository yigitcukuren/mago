# Configuration Reference

The **Mago** Analyzer is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor the analysis to your project's specific needs. All settings go under the `[analyzer]` table in your `mago.toml` file.

```toml
[analyzer]
# Disable a specific issue category
redundancy-issues = false

# Ignore a specific error code across the whole project
ignore = ["mixed-argument"]
```

## General Options

| Option     | Type       | Default | Description                                        |

| `excludes` | `string[]` | `[]`    | A list of glob patterns to exclude from analysis.  |
| `ignore`   | `string[]` | `[]`    | A list of specific issue codes to ignore globally. |

## Feature Flags

These flags control specific, powerful analysis capabilities.

| Option                                | Default | Description                                                                                          |
| :------------------------------------ | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find-unused-expressions`             | `true`  | Find and report expressions whose results are not used (e.g., `$a + $b;`).                           |
| `find-unused-definitions`             | `true`  | Find and report unused definitions (e.g., private methods that are never called).                    |
| `analyze-dead-code`                   | `true`  | Analyze code that appears to be unreachable.                                                         |
| `memoize-properties`                  | `false` | Track the literal values of class properties. Improves type inference but may increase memory usage. |
| `allow-possibly-undefined-array-keys` | `true`  | Allow accessing array keys that may not be defined without reporting an issue.                       |
| `check-throws`                        | `true`  | Check for unhandled thrown exceptions that are not caught or documented with `@throws`.              |
| `perform-heuristic-checks`            | `true`  | Perform extra heuristic checks for potential issues that are not strict typing errors.               |
