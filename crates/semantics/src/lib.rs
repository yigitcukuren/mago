//! # Mago Semantics Crate
//!
//! The `mago_semantics` crate provides semantic analysis capabilities for PHP code.
//! **Mago** is the name of the toolchain, and this crate processes PHP source code to generate
//! an abstract syntax tree (AST), performs name resolution, builds a symbol table, and detects
//! semantic issues.
//!
//! This crate is essential for the compilation pipeline of PHP within the Mago toolchain,
//! ensuring that source code adheres to the language's semantic rules before code generation
//! or interpretation.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Parsing**: Converts PHP source code into an AST.
//! - **Name Resolution**: Associates identifiers with their declarations.
//! - **Symbol Table Construction**: Records all symbols (classes, functions, variables) for quick lookup.
//! - **Semantic Analysis**: Checks for semantic correctness and reports issues.

    /// 3. **Symbol Table Construction**: Builds a symbol table containing all the symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) defined in the source code.
    /// 4. **Semantic Analysis**: Checks the AST for semantic correctness, such as type checking, scope rules, etc., and collects any issues.
